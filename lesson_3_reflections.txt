q1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
a1) a remote repository is required when you are working from multiple machines or when you are collaborating with other people. It also helps against losing your changes due to hard disk crash or other unforseen events.
q2)why might you want to pull changes manually rather than git having automatically stay up to date with your remote repository
a2) Pulling is required when we make changes from another machine or when one of our collaborators has pushed / commited changes . ( push transfers last commit(s) to a remote server , commit adds changes to your local repo. )
q3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
a3) fork is clone + linking(link to the original forked repository) on git hub server. you cannot fork local repositories. clone is making a copy of an existing repository, the existing repository can be local or remote(e.g. github). branching is adding a new label on your local repository for experimental changes/feature work. branching creates a new branch (default branch is master and creating a new branch will add a new label and changes you make there wont be accesible in master unless you merge them).
